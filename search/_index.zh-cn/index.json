The thumb has two bones (phalanges), meaning one joint. The thumb interphalangeal (IP) joint is similar to the distal interphalangeal (DIP) joint in the other fingers, both being the closest to the tip of the finger. The metacarpophalangeal joint (MP) is where the metacarpal (palm bones) meets the finger bones. The MP joint allows for us to bend the thumb, and is important for pinching and gripping things. The carpometacarpal joint (CMC), has the most capability of motion. It can bend the thumb away and toward the hand.\nWhat muscles allow for movement of the thumb? The skeletal muscles of the hand control the movement of the fingers. There are two types of muscles in the hand: extrinsic and intrinsic. Extrinsic ones have the muscle belly in the forearm, while intrinsic ones have the muscles in the phalanx (finger) or wrist. The intrinsic muscles are important for grip and pinch strength. The intrinsic hand muscles have four muscles: the thenar, hypothenar, interossei, and lumbrical. The thenar muscles are a collection of 3 muscles responsible for the movement of the thumb: the abductor pollicis brevis (APB), flexor pollicis brevis (FBB) and opponens pollicis (OPP).\nThe main motions the thumb can make are flexion, extension, abduction, adduction, and opposition. Flexion is done when you bring your thumb to the other side of the palm. Extension is the other way, sticking your thumb away from your pinky. Abduction is pointing you thumb perpendicular to your straightened fingers. Adduction is aligning your thumb with your straightened fingers. Opposition is touching any of your other fingers.\nIt is pretty obvious by the names what the APB, FBB, and OPP do, which is abduction, flexion, and opposition, respectively. However, it is important to note that adduction is caused by the adductor pollicis, which is not part of the thenar muscles.\nSources https://www.assh.org/handcare/safety/joints https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK539810/ https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-05riM9YaI Images https://www.assh.org/handcare/safety/joints https://radiopaedia.org/articles/thenar-eminence ","permalink":"https://125837492739.github.io/files/lenses/anatomy/","tags":null,"title":"Anatomy"},{"categories":null,"content":" How do macromolecules affect the development of thumbs? The thumb is not a normal digit. It is the last digit to form and is the most commonly affected when limb disruption happens. It is defined by the overlapping of the HOXA13, TBX5, GLI3R, and HOXD13 transcription factors, without other HOXD transcription factors. (I will explain this later.)\nBecause it is the last digit to form, the thumb has a greater risk of disruption, with over 1100 syndromes listed in the OMIM database. However, because of its greater risk of disruption, it has the potential to evolve quicker.\nDisruptions that decrease the size of fingers typically affect the thumb first.\nOne macromolecule that affects the production of thumbs is GLI3. GLI3 refers to both the gene that encodes the protein and the protein itself, which is a transcription factor. A transcription factor is a protein that regulates the transcription of genes. There are two types of transcription factors: activators and repressors.\nDuring transcription in eukaryotes, RNA polymerase needs basal (general) transcription factors to bind to the promoter to start transcription.\nActivator transcription factors bind to the DNA to make it easier for the RNA polymerase to bind to the promoter. Repressors can block the basal transcription factors, preventing RNA polymerase from binding to the promoter, preventing it from performing transcription.\nGLI3 can be both an activator and a repressor. The balance of GLI3 activator and GLI3 repressor is crucial for the development of the digits. The activator form of GLI3 is distributed across the developing hand by the Sonic Hedgehog Pathway (SHH), which is produced in the Zone of Polarizing Activity (ZPA), located in the posterior part of the limb bud (the pinky). Since the concentration of SHH is high near the pinky, it creates more GLI3 activator in that region, creating a gradient with more activator near the pinky and more repressor near the thumb. The high amount of GLI3 activator promotes the development of fingers. On the thumb side, where SHH signaling is weaker, there is a higher concentration of GLI3 repressor.\nProper development of the thumb requires this repression of digit formation. However, if SHH signaling is completely lost, there will be an excess of GLI3 repressor, causing digits not to form.\nTo illustrate all of this with a real example, scientists experimented with a chicken and a mouse. In the chicken, they reduced SHH signaling. This caused an excess of the GLI3 repressor, causing it to have no digits.\nIn the mouse, which had a dysfunctional GLI3 gene, it couldn\u0026#39;t maintain the activator to repressor gradient, which led it to have 8 digits, with none of them being the thumb (since GLI3 repressor is needed for that).\nWhat macromolecules allow the thumb to move? The muscles in the thumb are made up of muscle fibers, which are made of sarcomeres, which are made up of parallel thin actin and thick myosin filaments. When you want to move your thumb, a nerve impulse causes calcium ions to be released, which then bind to the actin. This binding causes the actin to move, exposing the myosin binding sites. Initially, each myosin head is attached to an ATP molecule, but it releases the phosphate and attaches to the actin. Then it releases the ADP, causing the actin to move again. Finally, ATP binds to the myosin heads, separating them from the actin and allowing the cycle to begin again.\nThis movement of the actin results in muscle contraction.\nSources https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3940735/ https://www.khanacademy.org/science/ap-biology/gene-expression-and-regulation/regulation-of-gene-expression-and-cell-specialization/a/eukaryotic-transcription-factors Images https://www.khanacademy.org/science/ap-biology/gene-expression-and-regulation/regulation-of-gene-expression-and-cell-specialization/a/eukaryotic-transcription-factors https://med.libretexts.org/Bookshelves/Anatomy_and_Physiology/Anatomy_and_Physiology_(Boundless)/17%3A_Cardiovascular_System%3A_The_Heart/17.3%3A_Cardiac_Muscle_Tissue/17.3A%3A_Mechanism_and_Contraction_Events_of_Cardiac_Muscle_Fibers https://www.earthslab.com/physiology/physiology-skeletal-muscle-contraction/ ","permalink":"https://125837492739.github.io/files/lenses/chemistry-of-life/","tags":null,"title":"Chemistry Of Life"},{"categories":null,"content":" How did we evolve to have longer and stronger opposable thumbs? For many millions of years, animals have had partially opposable thumbs. They had short thumbs and long fingers to swing on branches, since longer thumbs would get in the way.\nRecent research suggests that opposable thumbs as flexible and strong as ours evolved approximately 2 million years ago. Shorter thumbs and longer fingers are good for climbing, but our ancestors stopped living in the trees and started making tools more often. The transition to standing on two legs also reduced the problem of stepping on long thumbs.\nOur ancestors evolved to have longer and stronger thumbs through natural selection. Their thumb strength and length initially had variation. However, having longer and stronger thumbs granted better grip strength and dexterity, allowing the usage of complex tools and weapons. It allowed for using better tools that allowed killing larger animals for food, causing the ones with longer thumbs to experience an increase of their meat consumption and brain size, which increased their reproductive success. Since the strength and length of the thumb is heritable, their offspring had similar traits as well. Because of the selective pressure from predators and from the ability to get food, this resulted in change over generations to have longer and stronger thumbs, resulting in opposable thumbs 2 million years ago in South African hominins.\nHow do our thumbs differ from those of other animals? Our thumbs are longer and have more muscle than other animals. This allows us to perform intricate tasks like grabbing and using tools.\nIn contrast, animals that climb trees often have longer fingers and shorter thumbs, which allows them to climb branches better. For example, the spider monkey\u0026#39;s small thumbs allow it to swing from branch to branch without its thumbs getting in the way.\nSome animals, like pandas, have a false thumb. It is attached to their wrist and is much shorter than a human thumb. The slight hook of the false thumb allows pandas to grab bamboo better, and its short length prevents them from stepping on it when they walk.\nSources https://www.reuters.com/lifestyle/science/pandas-its-been-two-thumbs-up-millions-years-2022-06-30/ https://www.amnh.org/exhibitions/permanent/human-origins/understanding-our-past/living-primates/the-grasping-hand https://www.smithsonianmag.com/science-nature/how-dexterous-thumbs-may-have-helped-shape-evolution-two-million-years-ago-180976870/ https://www.smithsonianmag.com/science-nature/how-dexterous-thumbs-may-have-helped-shape-evolution-two-million-years-ago-180976870/ https://www.postregister.com/outdoors/humans-opposable-thumbs-grant-us-huge-advantages/article_87f0ce8c-c739-11ed-a365-4fadeb3996f9.html Images https://handfacts.wordpress.com/2011/06/11/hands-evolution-how-did-the-human-hand-evolve-in-time/ ","permalink":"https://125837492739.github.io/files/lenses/evolution/","tags":null,"title":"Evolution"},{"categories":null,"content":" What is an inheritable trait associated with thumbs? A trait in the thumb that is inherited from parents is the hitchhiker\u0026#39;s thumb.\nHitchhiker\u0026#39;s thumb is a trait in human thumbs that allows people to bend their thumbs back further than being straight (picture below).\nWhile it is often regarded as a simple Mendelian trait, it is not actually that simple, as we will see below.\nWhat gene controls the hitchhiker\u0026#39;s thumb? Actually, there isn\u0026#39;t one gene that controls whether you have a hitchhiker\u0026#39;s thumb.\nHitchhiker\u0026#39;s thumb is often described as a simple Mendelian trait, which is not exactly correct. This is suggested by the experiment conducted by Glass and Kistler in 1953. Their data is in the following table, with S and H being the phenotype for straight and hitchhiker\u0026#39;s, respectively.\nParents S offspring H offspring Percent S S x S 281 32 90% S x H 71 37 66% H x H 1 30 3% Their conclusion was that it was a simple Mendelian trait, with hitchhiker\u0026#39;s thumb being the recessive allele and straight thumbs being the dominant allele. However, there is one outlier that had a straight thumb even though both their parents had the hitchhiker\u0026#39;s thumb. This is impossible for a recessive Mendelian allele, shown by the following Punnett square:\nIf both the parents had the recessive hitchhiker\u0026#39;s thumb, then the offspring\u0026#39;s genotype should be two hitchhiker alleles, making the phenotype be a hitchhiker\u0026#39;s thumb. However, the one outlier in the experiment contradicts this. A possible explanation is incorrect paternity, but another experiment conducted by Beckman et al. disproves this further. Their data is shown in the following table:\nParents S offspring H offspring Percent S S x S 50 8 86% S x H 18 17 51% H x H 3 4 43% In this study, there were three people who had straight thumbs even though both of their parents have hitchhiker\u0026#39;s thumb. This further disproves the idea that the hitchhiker\u0026#39;s thumb is a simple Mendelian trait. Therefore, there are likely multiple genes or factors that control the hitchhiker\u0026#39;s thumb, not just one gene.\nWhat is the most common type of thumb: hitchhiker\u0026#39;s or straight? Actually, thumbs cannot be classified into the two categories of straight and hitchhiker\u0026#39;s.\nIn the Glass and Kistler experiment, they arbitrarily set the angle for hitchhiker\u0026#39;s thumb to be 50°, and counted everything below that to be a straight thumb. They also had multiple people measuring the thumbs, and repeated measurements of the same thumb often differed by many degrees. This means that a thumb could be classified differently depending on the person measuring.\nA different study to examine is one by Harris and Joseph in 1949, which measured the angle of the thumbs of 249 people. The data they collected is in the following table:\nThis shows that it is a spectrum, ranging from 0° to 90°, with most people being able to bend back 30°.\nSources https://udel.edu/~mcdonald/myththumb.html Images https://www.pinterest.com/pin/806848089468790091/ ","permalink":"https://125837492739.github.io/files/lenses/genetics/","tags":null,"title":"Genetics"},{"categories":null,"content":" Gene A segment of DNA that encodes for proteins.\nProtein A chain of amino acids that have many functions. They can mostly be divided into three uses: movers, builders, and pumps. Some examples of proteins are ATP synthase, lactase, and DNA polymerase.\nEnzyme An enzyme is a kind of protein that helps in chemical reactions. They are very specific, often only working for one particular chemical reaction.\nTo help a chemical reaction, enzymes can bind to specific reactant molecules, called substrates. Common things an enzyme can do is to break down a substrate, or to combine multiple substrates into a larger molecule.\nThe part of the enzyme where the binding of substrates happens is called the active site.\nTranscription The process where the information in DNA is copied into RNA.\nRNA Polymerase An enzyme that is used during transcription.\nPromoter A part of DNA that tells the RNA polymerase where to start transcription.\nDNA A double helix structure that contains the information for how to make proteins. It is made up of nucleotides, which are made of deoxyribose, phosphate, and one of four nitrogenous bases: A, T, C, or G. The sequence of the 4 letters can encode for a protein.\nRNA A structure that is similar to DNA, but usually single-stranded and has ribose instead of deoxyribose, and with U instead of T.\nATP A molecule that serves as the primary energy source in cells. It stands for Adenosine Triphosphate, which means that it is made of one adenosine molecule and three phosphates. ATP is commonly called the \u0026#34;energy currency\u0026#34; of the cell, since energy is released when breaking the bond between one of the phosphates and the rest of the molecule.\nADP A molecule that stands for Adenosine Diphosphate. It is the result after breaking the bond of the phosphate in the ATP. It is similar to a discharged battery, in that it can be \u0026#34;recharged\u0026#34; by adding another phosphate to it, converting it back to an ATP molecule.\nConcentration The amount of a substance divided by a larger volume. For example, with sugar in water, the concentration of sugar is the amount of sugar divided by the total volume of the sugar and the water.\nGradient A difference in the concentration between two regions.\nDiffusion The movement of molecules from an area of high concentration to an area of low concentration without external energy.\nThis works by a simple probability problem. If there are 20 people in a room, and 0 people in another room, and people start to walk around randomly, then it is likely that both rooms will be filled.\nTherefore, it is not actually individual molecules moving from one region to another, but rather the net movement of molecules.\nChannels Proteins in the cell membrane that allow the passage of molecules. They can be gated, meaning that they can open or close.\nThe movement of molecules through channels is powered by diffusion, with no additional energy needed to move molecules from regions with high concentration to regions with low concentration.\nEukaryotes An organism with a nucleus.\nProkaryotes An organism without a nucleus.\nEvolution The process where living organisms change over time.\nVariation Differences in some trait of individuals in a population.\nHeritability The ability for a trait to be passed down to the next generation.\nSelective Pressure External factors that affect an organism\u0026#39;s survival.\nReproductive Success The ability of an organism to pass reproduce.\nUnequal Reproductive Success The difference of reproductive success between individuals in a population.\nChange Over Generations The change of traits across multiple generations.\nNatural Selection The process that drives evolution, in which organisms having advantageous traits are more likely to reproduce, passing that trait onto their offspring.\nIn order for natural selection to happen, there needs to be variation of traits in a population, which need to be heritable.\nA selective pressure then kills many individuals, leaving the ones with the traits best fit to survive that selective pressure. That means that certain traits will have unequal reproductive success, meaning that there will be a change of the amount of individuals with that trait in the next generation.\nOver time, the trait with the best reproductive success will become more common. Therefore, natural selection drives the evolution of a species over time.\nSimple Mendelian Trait A trait controlled by a single gene that follows simple rules of inheritance.\nAllele One of the versions of a gene.\nCommonly, an individual inherits one allele from each parent. Typically when talking about a Mendelian trait, one of the alleles is dominant and one is recessive. There can also be incomplete and codominance, but I will not explain that in this glossary.\nThis means that if an individual has a dominant allele, they will have the trait that is defined by the dominant allele.\nThe recessive trait is only displayed when they have two of the recessive alleles.\nWhen two parents produce offspring, the probability of the phenotype of the offspring depends on the genotypes of the parents. This can be calculated using a Punnett Square.\nHeterozygote An individual with one dominant allele and one recessive allele.\nHomozygote An individual with two of the same allele (dominant or recessive).\nGenotype The combination of alleles for a given gene.\nPhenotype The observable characteristics, determined by the genotype.\nPunnett Square A diagram used to calculate the genotype combinations of an offspring given the genotypes of the parents.\nA typical Punnett square is shown below:\nIn this Punnett square, both the parents have one of the dominant allele and one of the recessive allele, with capital A being the dominant one. The offspring randomly gets one of the two alleles from each parent. This square shows the possible combinations.\nFrom this, we can see that two heterozygote parents will only have a 25% chance of having an offspring with the recessive trait (genotype aa).\n","permalink":"https://125837492739.github.io/files/glossary/","tags":null,"title":"Glossary"},{"categories":null,"content":" How do gradients and diffusion play a role in the movement of thumbs? The movement of the thumb, like other muscles in the body, is influenced by gradients and diffusion. One of the molecules involved in this process is the calcium ion. As I explained in the chemistry of life lens, muscle fibers are made up of sarcomeres, and are triggered to contract by calcium ions.\nWhen you want to move your thumb, nerve impulses cause calcium channels to open. This allows calcium ions to flow from the area with higher concentration (the sarcoplasmic reticulum) to the area with lower concentration (the sarcomere). Because of diffusion, the calcium ions are spread throughout the sarcomere, allowing the muscle to contract uniformly. After the contraction, calcium ions are transported back to the sarcoplasmic reticulum using energy from ATP.\nHow do gradients and diffusion play a role in the development of thumbs? As I explained in the chemistry of life lens, the Sonic Hedgehog Pathway (SHH) controls the development of the thumb, and is produced in the ZPA, near the pinky. SHH diffuses from the pinky side to the thumb side, creating a gradient. This SHH gradient establishes the GLI3 activator to repressor gradient, since regions with higher concentration of SHH will have higher concentration of GLI3 activator. This gradient is crucial for the development of the thumb.\nSources https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2NPtiYNuNrE https://125837492739.github.io/files/lenses/chemistry-of-life/ Images https://www.mit.edu/~kardar/teaching/projects/chemotaxis%28AndreaSchmidt%29/gradients.htm ","permalink":"https://125837492739.github.io/files/lenses/membranes-and-transport/","tags":null,"title":"Membranes And Transport"}]
