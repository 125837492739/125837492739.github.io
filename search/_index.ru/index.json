The thumb has two bones (phalanges), meaning one joint. The thumb interphalangeal (IP) joint is similar to the distal interphalangeal (DIP) joint in the other fingers, both being the closest to the tip of the finger. The Metacarpophalangeal Joint (MP) is where the metacarpal (palm bones) meets the finger bones. The MP joint allows for us to bend the thumb, and is important for pinching and gripping things. The Carpometacarpal Joint (CMC), has the most capability of motion. It can bend the thumb away and toward the hand.\nWhat muscles allow for movement of the thumb? The skeletal muscles of the hand control the movement of the fingers. There are two types of muscles in the hand: extrinsic and intrinsic. Extrinsic ones have the muscle belly in the forearm, while intrinsic ones have the muscles in the phalanx (finger) or wrist. The intrinsic muscles are important for grip and pinch strength. The intrinsic hand muscles have four muscles: the thenar, hypothenar, interossei, and lumbrical. The thenar muscles are a collection of 3 muscles responsible for the movement of the thumb: the abductor pollicis brevis (APB), flexor pollicis brevis (FBB) and opponens pollicis (OPP).\nThe main motions the thumb can make are flexion, extension, abduction, adduction, and opposition. Flexion is done when you bring your thumb to the other side of the palm. Extension is the other way, sticking your thumb away from your pinky. Abduction is pointing you thumb perpendicular to your straightened fingers. Adduction is aligning your thumb with your straightened fingers. Opposition is touching any of your other fingers.\nIt is pretty obvious by the names what the APB, FBB, and OPP do, which is abduction, flexion, and opposition, respectively. However, it is important to note that adduction is caused by the adductor pollicis, which is not part of the thenar muscles.\nSources https://www.assh.org/handcare/safety/joints https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK539810/ https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-05riM9YaI Images https://www.assh.org/handcare/safety/joints https://radiopaedia.org/articles/thenar-eminence ","permalink":"https://125837492739.github.io/files/lenses/anatomy/","tags":null,"title":"Anatomy"},{"categories":null,"content":" How do macromolecules affect the production of human thumbs? The thumb is not a normal digit. It is the last digit to form and is the most commonly affected when limb disruption happens. It is defined by the overlapping of the HOXA13, TBX5, GLI3R, and HOXD13 transcription factors, without other HOXD transcription factors. (I will explain this later.)\nBecause it is the last digit to form, the thumb has a greater risk of disruption, with over 1100 syndromes listed in the OMIM database. However, because of its greater risk of disruption, it has the potential to evolve quicker.\nDisruptions that decrease the size of fingers typically affect the thumb first.\nOne macromolecule that affects the production of thumbs is GLI3. GLI3 refers to both the gene that encodes the protein and the protein itself, which is a transcription factor. A transcription factor is a protein that regulates the transcription of genes. There are two types of transcription factors: activators and repressors.\nDuring transcription in eukaryotes, RNA polymerase needs basal (general) transcription factors to bind to the promoter to start transcription.\nActivator transcription factors bind to the DNA to make it easier for the RNA polymerase to bind to the promoter. Repressors can block the basal transcription factors, preventing RNA polymerase from binding to the promoter, preventing it from performing transcription.\nGLI3 can be both an activator and a repressor. The balance of GLI3 activator and GLI3 repressor is crucial for the development of the digits. The activator form of GLI3 is distributed across the developing hand by the Sonic Hedgehog Pathway (SHH), which is produced in the Zone of Polarizing Activity (ZPA), located in the posterior part of the limb bud (the pinky). Since the concentration of SHH is high near the pinky, it creates more GLI3 activator in that region, creating a gradient with more activator near the pinky and more repressor near the thumb. The high amont of GLI3 activator promotes the development of fingers. On the thumb side, where SHH signaling is weaker, there is a higher concentration of GLI3 repressor.\nProper development of the thumb requires this repression of digit formation. However, if SHH signaling is completely lost, there will be an excess of GLI3 repressor, causing digits not to form.\nTo illustrate all of this with a real example, scientists experimented with a chicken and a mouse. In the chicken, they reduced SHH signaling. This caused an excess of the GLI3 repressor, causing it to have no digits.\nIn the mouse, which had a dysfunctional GLI3 gene, it couldn\u0026#39;t maintain the activator to repressor gradient, which led it to have 8 digits, with none of them being the thumb (since GLI3 repressor is needed for that).\nWhat macromolecules allow the muscles around the thumb to move the thumb? The muscles in the thumb are made up of muscle fibers, which are made of sarcomeres, which are made up of parallel thin actin and thick myosin filaments. When you want to move your thumb, a nerve impulse causes calcium ions to be released, which then bind to the actin. This binding causes the actin to move, exposing the myosin binding sites. Initially, each myosin head is attached to an ATP molecule, but it releases the phosphate and attaches to the actin. Then it releases the ADP, causing the actin to move again. Finally, ATP binds to the myosin heads, separating them from the actin and allowing the cycle to begin again.\nThis movement of the actin results in muscle contraction.\nSources https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3940735/ https://www.khanacademy.org/science/ap-biology/gene-expression-and-regulation/regulation-of-gene-expression-and-cell-specialization/a/eukaryotic-transcription-factors Images https://www.khanacademy.org/science/ap-biology/gene-expression-and-regulation/regulation-of-gene-expression-and-cell-specialization/a/eukaryotic-transcription-factors https://med.libretexts.org/Bookshelves/Anatomy_and_Physiology/Anatomy_and_Physiology_(Boundless)/17%3A_Cardiovascular_System%3A_The_Heart/17.3%3A_Cardiac_Muscle_Tissue/17.3A%3A_Mechanism_and_Contraction_Events_of_Cardiac_Muscle_Fibers https://www.earthslab.com/physiology/physiology-skeletal-muscle-contraction/ ","permalink":"https://125837492739.github.io/files/lenses/chemistry-of-life/","tags":null,"title":"Chemistry Of Life"},{"categories":null,"content":" How did we evolve to have longer and stronger opposable thumbs? For many millions of years, animals have had partially opposable thumbs. They had short thumbs and long fingers to swing on branches, since longer thumbs would get in the way.\nRecent research suggests that opposable thumbs as flexible and strong as ours evolved approximately 2 million years ago. Shorter thumbs and longer fingers are good for climbing, but our ancestors stopped living in the trees and started making tools more often. The transition to standing on two legs also reduced the problem of stepping on long thumbs.\nOur ancestor\u0026#39;s thumb strength and length initially had variation. However, having longer and stronger thumbs granted better grip strength and dexterity, allowing the usage of complex tools and weapons. It allowed for using better tools that allowed killing larger animals for food, causing the ones with longer thumbs to experience an increase of their meat consumption and brain size, which increased their reproductive success. Since the strength and length of the thumb is heritable, their offspring had similar traits as well. Because of the selective pressure from predators and from the ability to get food, thumbs evolved to become longer and stronger over time, resulting in opposable thumbs 2 million years ago in South African hominins.\nHow do our thumbs differ from the thumbs of other animals? Our thumbs are longer and have more muscle than other animals. This allows us to perform intricate tasks like grabbing and using tools.\nIn contrast, animals that climb trees often have longer fingers and shorter thumbs, which allows them to climb branches better. For example, the spider monkey\u0026#39;s small thumbs allow them to swing from branch to branch without their thumbs getting in the way.\nSome animals, like pandas have a false thumb. It attached to their wrist and is much shorter than a human thumb. The slight hook of the false thumb allows pandas to grab bamboo better, and its short length prevents them from stepping on it when they walk.\nSources https://www.reuters.com/lifestyle/science/pandas-its-been-two-thumbs-up-millions-years-2022-06-30/ https://www.amnh.org/exhibitions/permanent/human-origins/understanding-our-past/living-primates/the-grasping-hand https://www.smithsonianmag.com/science-nature/how-dexterous-thumbs-may-have-helped-shape-evolution-two-million-years-ago-180976870/ https://www.smithsonianmag.com/science-nature/how-dexterous-thumbs-may-have-helped-shape-evolution-two-million-years-ago-180976870/ https://www.postregister.com/outdoors/humans-opposable-thumbs-grant-us-huge-advantages/article_87f0ce8c-c739-11ed-a365-4fadeb3996f9.html Images https://handfacts.wordpress.com/2011/06/11/hands-evolution-how-did-the-human-hand-evolve-in-time/ ","permalink":"https://125837492739.github.io/files/lenses/evolution/","tags":null,"title":"Evolution"},{"categories":null,"content":" What are some traits in thumbs that can be passed down from parent to child? A trait that is passed down from parent to child is the hitchhiker\u0026#39;s thumb.\nHitchhiker\u0026#39;s thumb is a trait in human thumbs that allows people to bend their thumbs back further than being straight (picture below).\nWhile it is often regarded as a simple Mendelian trait, it is not actually that simple, as we will see below.\nWhat gene controls the hitchhiker\u0026#39;s thumb? Actually, there isn\u0026#39;t one gene that controls whether you have a hitchhiker\u0026#39;s thumb.\nHitchhiker\u0026#39;s thumb is often described as a simple Mendelian trait, which is not exactly correct. This is suggested by the experiment conducted by Glass and Kistler in 1953. Their data is in the following table, with S and H being the phenotype for straight and hitchhiker\u0026#39;s, respectively.\nParents S offspring H offspring Percent S S x S 281 32 90% S x H 71 37 66% H x H 1 30 3% Their conclusion was that it was a simple Mendelian trait, with hitchhiker\u0026#39;s thumb being the recessive allele and straight thumbs being the dominant allele. However, there is one outlier that had a straight thumb even though both their parents had the hitchhiker\u0026#39;s thumb. This is impossible for a recessive Mendelian allele, shown by the following Punnett square:\nIf both the parents had the recessive hitchhiker\u0026#39;s thumb, then the offspring\u0026#39;s genotype should be two hitchhiker alleles, making the phenotype be a hitchhiker\u0026#39;s thumb. However, the one outlier in the experiment contradicts this. A possible explanation is incorrect paternity, but another experiment conducted by Beckman et al. disproves this further. Their data is shown in the following table:\nParents S offspring H offspring Percent S S x S 50 8 86% S x H 18 17 51% H x H 3 4 43% In this study, there were three people who had straight thumbs even though both of their parents have hitchhiker\u0026#39;s thumb. This further disproves the idea that the hitchhiker\u0026#39;s thumb is a simple Mendelian trait. Therefore, there are likely multiple genes or factors that control the hitchhiker\u0026#39;s thumb, not just one gene.\nWhat is the most common type of thumb: hitchhiker\u0026#39;s or straight? Actually, thumbs cannot be classified into the two categories of straight and hitchhiker\u0026#39;s.\nIn the Glass and Kistler experiment, they arbitrarily set the angle for hitchhiker\u0026#39;s thumb to be 50°, and counted everything below that to be a straight thumb. They also had multiple people measuring the thumbs, and repeated measurements of the same thumb often differed by many degrees. This means that a thumb could be classified differently depending on the person measuring.\nA different study to examine is one by Harris and Joseph in 1949, which measured the angle of the thumbs of 249 people. The data they collected is in the following table:\nThis shows that it is a spectrum, ranging from 0° to 90°, with most people being able to bend back 30°.\nSources https://udel.edu/~mcdonald/myththumb.html Images https://www.pinterest.com/pin/806848089468790091/ ","permalink":"https://125837492739.github.io/files/lenses/genetics/","tags":null,"title":"Genetics"},{"categories":null,"content":" Reproductive Success This is how well they can reproduce\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 ","permalink":"https://125837492739.github.io/files/glossary/","tags":null,"title":"Glossary"},{"categories":null,"content":" How do gradients and diffusion play a role in the movement of thumbs? The movement of the thumb, like other muscles in the body, is influenced by gradients and diffusion. One of the molecules involved in this process is the calcium ion. As I explained in the chemistry of life lens, muscle fibers are made up of sarcomeres, and are triggered to contract by calcium ions.\nWhen you want to move your thumb, nerve impulses cause calcium channels to open. This allows calcium ions to flow from the area with higher concentration (sarcoplasmic reticulum) to the area with lower concentration (the sarcomere). Because of diffusion, the calcium ions are spread throughout the sarcomere, allowing the muscle to contract uniformly. After the contraction, calcium ions are transported back to the sarcoplasmic reticulum using energy from ATP.\nHow do gradients and diffusion play a role in the development of thumbs? As I explained in the chemistry of life lens, the Sonic Hedgehog Pathway (SHH) controls the development of the thumb, and is produced in the ZPA, near the pinky. SHH diffuses from the pinky side to the thumb side, creating a gradient. This SHH gradient establishes the GLI3 activator to repressor gradient, since regions with higher concentration of SHH will have higher concentration of GLI3 activator. This gradient is crucial for the development of the thumb.\nSources https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2NPtiYNuNrE https://125837492739.github.io/files/lenses/chemistry-of-life/ ","permalink":"https://125837492739.github.io/files/lenses/membranes-and-transport/","tags":null,"title":"Membranes And Transport"}]
