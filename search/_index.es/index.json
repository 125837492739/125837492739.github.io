How did we evolve to have longer and stronger thumbs? We initially had short thumbs and long fingers to swing on branches. Longer thumbs would get in the way, but after our ancestors stopped climbing trees, this was no longer a problem.\nOur ancestor\u0026#39;s thumb strength and length initially had variation. However, having longer and stronger thumbs granted better grip strength and dexterity, allowing the usage of complex tools and weapons. It allowed for using better tools that allowed killing larger animals for food, causing the ones with longer thumbs to experience an increase of their meat consumption and brain size, which increased their reproductive success. Since the strength and length of the thumb is heritable, their offspring had similar traits as well. Because of the selective pressure from predators and from the ability to get food, thumbs evolved to become longer and stronger over time.\nHow do our thumbs differ from the thumbs of other animals? Our thumbs are longer and have more muscle than other animals. This allows us to perform intricate tasks like grabbing and using tools.\nIn contrast, animals that climb trees often have longer fingers and shorter thumbs, which allows them to climb branches better. For example, the spider monkey\u0026#39;s small thumbs allow them to swing from branch to branch without their thumbs getting in the way.\nSome animals, like pandas have a false thumb. It attached to their wrist and is much shorter than a human thumb. The slight hook of the false thumb allows pandas to grab bamboo better, and its short length prevents them from stepping on it when they walk.\nSources https://www.reuters.com/lifestyle/science/pandas-its-been-two-thumbs-up-millions-years-2022-06-30/ https://www.amnh.org/exhibitions/permanent/human-origins/understanding-our-past/living-primates/the-grasping-hand https://www.smithsonianmag.com/science-nature/how-dexterous-thumbs-may-have-helped-shape-evolution-two-million-years-ago-180976870/ https://www.smithsonianmag.com/science-nature/how-dexterous-thumbs-may-have-helped-shape-evolution-two-million-years-ago-180976870/ https://www.postregister.com/outdoors/humans-opposable-thumbs-grant-us-huge-advantages/article_87f0ce8c-c739-11ed-a365-4fadeb3996f9.html Images https://handfacts.wordpress.com/2011/06/11/hands-evolution-how-did-the-human-hand-evolve-in-time/ ","permalink":"https://125837492739.github.io/files/lenses/evolution/","tags":null,"title":"Evolution"},{"categories":null,"content":" What are some traits in thumbs that can be passed down from parent to child? A trait that is passed down from parent to child is the hitchhiker\u0026#39;s thumb.\nHitchhiker\u0026#39;s thumb is a trait in human thumbs that allows people to bend their thumbs back further than being straight (picture below).\nWhile it is often regarded as a simple Mendelian trait, it is not actually that simple, as we will see below.\nWhat gene controls the hitchhiker\u0026#39;s thumb? Actually, there isn\u0026#39;t one gene that controls whether you have a hitchhiker\u0026#39;s thumb.\nHitchhiker\u0026#39;s thumb is often described as a simple Mendelian trait, which is not exactly correct. This is suggested by the experiment conducted by Glass and Kistler in 1953. Their data is in the following table, with S and H being the phenotype for straight and hitchhiker\u0026#39;s, respectively.\nParents S offspring H offspring Percent S S x S 281 32 90% S x H 71 37 66% H x H 1 30 3% Their conclusion was that it was a simple Mendelian trait, with hitchhiker\u0026#39;s thumb being the recessive allele and straight thumbs being the dominant allele. However, there is one outlier that had a straight thumb even though both their parents had the hitchhiker\u0026#39;s thumb. This is impossible for a recessive Mendelian allele, shown by the following Punnett square:\nIf both the parents had the recessive hitchhiker\u0026#39;s thumb, then the offspring\u0026#39;s genotype should be two hitchhiker alleles, making the phenotype be a hitchhiker\u0026#39;s thumb. However, the one outlier in the experiment contradicts this. A possible explanation is incorrect paternity, but another experiment conducted by Beckman et al. disproves this further. Their data is shown in the following table:\nParents S offspring H offspring Percent S S x S 50 8 86% S x H 18 17 51% H x H 3 4 43% In this study, there were three people who had straight thumbs even though both of their parents have hitchhiker\u0026#39;s thumb. This further disproves the idea that the hitchhiker\u0026#39;s thumb is a simple Mendelian trait. Therefore, there are likely multiple genes or factors that control the hitchhiker\u0026#39;s thumb, not just one gene.\nWhat is the most common type of thumb: hitchhiker\u0026#39;s or straight? Actually, thumbs cannot be classified into the two categories of straight and hitchhiker\u0026#39;s.\nIn the Glass and Kistler experiment, they arbitrarily set the angle for hitchhiker\u0026#39;s thumb to be 50째, and counted everything below that to be a straight thumb. They also had multiple people measuring the thumbs, and repeated measurements of the same thumb often differed by many degrees. This means that a thumb could be classified differently depending on the person measuring.\nA different study to examine is one by Harris and Joseph in 1949, which measured the angle of the thumbs of 249 people. The data they collected is in the following table:\nThis shows that it is a spectrum, ranging from 0째 to 90째, with most people being able to bend back 30째.\nSources Images https://www.pinterest.com/pin/806848089468790091/ ","permalink":"https://125837492739.github.io/files/lenses/genetics/","tags":null,"title":"Genetics"},{"categories":null,"content":" Reproductive Success This is how well they can reproduce\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 ","permalink":"https://125837492739.github.io/files/glossary/","tags":null,"title":"Glossary"},{"categories":null,"content":"","permalink":"https://125837492739.github.io/files/lenses/membranes-and-transport/","tags":null,"title":"Membranes And Transport"}]
